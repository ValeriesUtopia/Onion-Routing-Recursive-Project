# Onion-Routing-Recursive-Project
ðŸ§  Core Idea Recap
Weâ€™re building a recursive class that:
Accepts a binary number as an array of ints (e.g., {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}).
Recursively peels off the outer bits.
Flips the center bit when only one remains.
Reconstructs the binary number with the flipped center and original outer bits.
